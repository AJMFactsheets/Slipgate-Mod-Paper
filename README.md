# Slipgate-Mod-Paper
Paper plugin that tries to emulate the Forge version of the Slipgate Mod. I will be supporting this more since I plan to use it on my personal minecraft server.

Also written in Kotlin! Check releases for an executable Jar since I'm still pretty new to Kotlin. :P 
If I did something "badly" in Kotlin please open an issue! Issues/PRs attempting to refactor janky Kotlin code will be accepted and are welcomed!

This should work on Paper servers and forks of Paper, but I don't believe I ended up using any Paper API's so might also work on Spigot/CraftBukkit and forks, but not tested.
